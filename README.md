## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

- npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
- A running PostgreSQL database instance.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```
2.  **Install NPM packages**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Set up environment variables**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add the following variables. Replace the placeholder values with your actual data.

    ```env
    # Example .env.local
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=public"
    NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-super-secret-key-for-nextauth"
    ```

    > **Note:** You can generate a `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` by running `openssl rand -base64 32` in your terminal.

4.  **Set up the database schema**
    Push the Prisma schema to your database. This will create the necessary tables.

    ```sh
    npx prisma db push
    ```

5.  **Run the development server**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deployment

This application is optimized for deployment on **Vercel**.

1.  **Push your code** to a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository.
2.  **Create a new project** on Vercel and import your repository.
